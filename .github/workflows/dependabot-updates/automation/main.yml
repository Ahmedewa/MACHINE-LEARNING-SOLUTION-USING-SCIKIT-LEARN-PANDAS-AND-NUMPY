#### **Step 2: Automate Dependency Testing with CI/CD**

**CI/CD Pipeline for Testing  Pull Requests**

1. Add a GitHub Actions workflow to test updates in a staging environment.

**Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test-dependabot.yml`):
```yaml
name: Test Dependabot Updates

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - "requirements.txt"

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set Up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.9

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: pytest
```

2. **What This Does**:
   - Runs tests automatically on pull requests created by Dependabot.
   - Verifies that dependency updates do not break functionality.

#### **Step 3: Review and Merge Dependabot PRs**
- **In the GitHub UI**:
  - Check for successful CI/CD test runs.
  - Review the changes in dependencies (e.g., changelogs, release notes).
  - Merge the PR after confirming compatibility.

---

### **1.3 Best Practices for Reviewing Updates**
1. **Use a Staging Branch**:
   - Merge Dependabot PRs into a staging branch for additional testing before deploying to production.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b staging
   git merge dependabot-branch
   ```

2. **Read Changelogs**:
   - Check for breaking changes or deprecations in dependency changelogs.

3. **Test Critical Features**:
   - Focus on testing critical ML pipeline steps (e.g., model training, evaluation).
