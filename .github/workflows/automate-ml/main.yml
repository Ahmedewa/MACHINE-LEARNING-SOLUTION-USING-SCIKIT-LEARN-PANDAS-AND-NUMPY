### **Split GitHub Deployment into Phases**

#### **Testing Phase**
```yaml
name: Testing

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run Tests
        run: pytest
```


### **4.3 Deploying to Streamlit Cloud**
1. Write the Streamlit app:
   ```python
   import streamlit as st

   st.title("ML App")
   st.write("This is a demo ML app.")
   ```
2. Push the code to GitHub.
3. Link your repository to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
