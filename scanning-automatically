        TESTS-AUTOMATION


#### **How to Automate Tests**

1. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Use GitHub Actions to automate testing:
     ```yaml
     name: Firebase Emulator Tests

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       test:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - name: Checkout Code
             uses: actions/checkout@v3

           - name: Install Firebase CLI
             run: npm install -g firebase-tools

           - name: Start Emulator
             run: firebase emulators:start --only firestore,auth --project test --headless &

           - name: Run Tests
             run: npm test
     ```

2. **Write Tests for Security Rules**:
   - Use the Firebase Rules Unit Testing library (as shown in **Section 1.1**).

3. **Run Vulnerability Scans**:
   - Use **Snyk** CLI in your pipeline:
     ```yaml
     - name: Run Snyk Vulnerability Scan
       run: snyk test
     ```

### **2.3 Monitor Continuously**

#### **Why Monitor Continuously?**
- Detect vulnerabilities or issues early.
- Ensure the app remains secure and functional over time.

#### **How to Monitor Continuously**

1. **OWASP ZAP Integration**:
   - Automate scans in CI/CD pipelines:
     ```yaml
     - name: Run OWASP ZAP Scan
       run: zap-cli quick-scan http://localhost:5000
     ```

2. **Snyk Integration**:
   - Add Snyk to your pipeline for continuous monitoring:
     ```yaml
     - name: Monitor with Snyk
       run: snyk monitor
     ```

3. **Firebase Emulator Monitoring**:
   - Use the Firebase Emulator UI to monitor Firestore/Auth activity during tests.
