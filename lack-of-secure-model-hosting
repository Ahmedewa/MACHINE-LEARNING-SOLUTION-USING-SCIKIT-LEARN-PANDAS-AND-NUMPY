                     LACK OF SECURE MODEL HOSTING

### **1.8 Lack of Secure Model Hosting**
- **Description**: Hosting models on insecure servers leaves them vulnerable to unauthorized access.
- **Examples**:
  - Exposing a model on an open port without any authentication.
- **Prevention**:
  - Use secure model-serving frameworks like **TF Serving** or **TorchServe** behind a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX).
  - Enable HTTPS by deploying SSL/TLS certificates.
