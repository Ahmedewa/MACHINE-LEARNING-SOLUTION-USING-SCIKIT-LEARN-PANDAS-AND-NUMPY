                 SETTING-UP -SNYK


## **Setting Up Snyk with a CI/CD Pipeline**

### **2.1 Overview of Snyk**
- **Purpose**: Snyk identifies and fixes vulnerabilities in dependencies, Docker images, 
and infrastructure as code (IaC).
- **Integration**: Works with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, and other CI/CD tools.

---

### ** Prerequisites**
1. **Install Snyk CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g snyk
   ```
2. **Authenticate Snyk**:
   ```bash
   snyk auth
   ```
   Follow the link provided and log in with your Snyk account.

3. **Add Your Project to Snyk**:
   ```bash
   snyk monitor
   ```

### ** Integrating Snyk with GitHub Actions**

1. **Set Up a Workflow**:
   - Create a `.github/workflows/snyk.yml` file:
     ```yaml
     name: Snyk Security Scan

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main
       pull_request:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       security:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - name: Checkout Code
             uses: actions/checkout@v3

           - name: Set Up Python
             uses: actions/setup-python@v4
             with:
               python-version: 3.9

           - name: Install Dependencies
             run: pip install -r requirements.txt

           - name: Run Snyk Test
             env:
               SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
             run: snyk test
     ```

2. **Store Snyk Token**:
   - Go to **GitHub Repository Settings > Secrets > Actions** and add `SNYK_TOKEN` with your Snyk API token.

3. **How It Works**:
   - On every push or pull request, the workflow:
     - Installs dependencies.
     - Runs `snyk test`, which scans for vulnerabilities and outputs a detailed report.

### **2.4 Example: Integrating Snyk with Jenkins**

1. **Install Snyk Plugin**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins** and install the **Snyk Security** plugin.

2. **Configure Snyk in Jenkins**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins > Configure System**.
   - Add your **Snyk API token** under the "Snyk" section.

3. **Add Snyk to Your Jenkins Pipeline**:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Security Scan') {
               steps {
                   snykSecurity test: '', failOnIssues: true
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **2.5 Monitoring Vulnerabilities**
- **Snyk Monitor**:
  - Run this command to continuously monitor your project:
    ```bash
    snyk monitor
    ```
  - View the results in the Snyk dashboard.

---

### **2.6 Best Practices for Snyk**
1. **Integrate at Every Stage**:
   - Scan dependencies, Docker images, and IaC configurations during development and deployment.
2. **Automate Fixes**:
   - Use `snyk fix` to automatically resolve vulnerabilities:
     ```bash
     snyk fix
     ```

---

## **Conclusion**

1. **Common Security Vulnerabilities**:
   - Vulnerabilities like insecure dependencies, model theft, and adversarial attacks can compromise ML apps. Prevent these with dependency scanning, input validation, and secure APIs.

2. **Snyk in CI/CD**:
   - Snyk simplifies security by automating vulnerability scanning in your CI/CD pipelines. Tools like **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins** make integration seamless.

By addressing vulnerabilities systematically and integrating tools like Snyk, you can ensure a **robust, secure, and maintainable ML app**. Let me know if you'd like further customization or assistance with your setup! ðŸš€
