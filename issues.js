COMMON ISSUES USING DOKER FOR ML  PROJECTS/SOLUTIONS

## **1. Common Issues When Using Docker for ML Projects and Solutions**

### **1.1 Common Issues**
#### **a. Large Image Sizes**
- **Problem**: ML projects require large dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), resulting in bloated Docker images.
- **Solution**:
  - Start with a lightweight base image.
  - Use multi-stage builds to minimize the final image size.
  - Example:
    ```dockerfile
    # Stage 1: Build dependencies
    FROM python:3.9-slim AS builder
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Stage 2: Final image
    FROM python:3.9-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
    COPY . .
    CMD ["python", "app.py"]
    ```
