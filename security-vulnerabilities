        COMMON SECURITY VULNERABILITIES/PREVENTIVE MEASURES


**Common security
vulnerabilities in Machine Learning (ML) apps** and how to **prevent them**, 
along with detailed instructions on integrating **Snyk** into a **CI/CD pipeline** for automated security management.

---

## **1. Common Security Vulnerabilities in ML Apps and How to Prevent Them**

### **1.1 Vulnerable Dependencies**
- **Description**: ML apps often rely on open-source libraries (e.g., NumPy, TensorFlow, Flask), which may have vulnerabilities.
- **Code**:
  - Outdated versions of **Flask** may allow cross-site scripting (XSS).
  - Python **Pillow** library reported arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities in older versions.
- **Prevention**:
  - Use tools like **Snyk** or **Dependabot** to scan and update dependencies.
  - Pin dependency versions in `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`.
    ```plaintext
    Flask==2.0.3
    TensorFlow==2.9.1
    ```

---

### **1.2 Model Poisoning (Data Poisoning)**
- **Description**: Attackers manipulate training data to alter the model's behavior, causing incorrect predictions.
- **Code**:
  - Poisoning facial recognition systems to misidentify individuals.
- **Prevention**:
  - Validate data integrity using checksums or hashes.
  - Use **differential privacy** to add noise to training data, reducing the impact of poisoned samples.

---

### **1.3 Adversarial Attacks**
- **Description**: Attackers craft inputs that trick the ML model into making incorrect predictions.
- **Code**:
  - Adding imperceptible noise to an image causes a classifier to mislabel it.
- **Prevention**:
  - Apply **adversarial training** by exposing the model to adversarial examples during training.
  - Use input sanitization techniques to detect and filter adversarial inputs.

---

### **1.4 Insecure APIs**
- **Description**: ML apps expose APIs for predictions or model serving that may be exploited.
- **Code**:
  - Lack of authentication or rate limiting allows unauthorized users to abuse the API.
- **Prevention**:
  - Implement **authentication** and **authorization** (e.g., OAuth2, API keys).
  - Use **rate limiting** to prevent abuse.
    ```python
    from flask_limiter import Limiter
    limiter = Limiter(app, default_limits=["100 per minute"])
    ```

---

### **1.5 Model Theft**
- **Description**: Attackers steal your model by accessing APIs and reconstructing the model through repeated queries.
- **Code**:
  - Extracting a proprietary ML model by observing its predictions.
- **Prevention**:
  - Use **rate limiting** to restrict excessive API calls.
  - Add **watermarking** to your model outputs to detect unauthorized usage.
  - Encrypt the model file (`model.pkl`) using tools like **Fernet**.
    ```python
    from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
    key = Fernet.generate_key()
    cipher = Fernet(key)
    encrypted_model = cipher.encrypt(model_file.read())
    ```

---

### **1.6 Lack of Explainability**
- **Description**: Black-box models make it difficult to understand why a prediction was made, leading to trust and security issues.
- **Code**:
  - A healthcare ML app denies treatment without justification.
- **Prevention**:
  - Use **Explainable AI (XAI)** frameworks like SHAP or LIME to provide insights into model decisions.
  - SHAP:
    ```python
    import shap
    explainer = shap.Explainer(model.predict, X_train)
    shap_values = explainer(X_test)
    shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)
    ```

---

### **1.7 Hardcoded Secrets**
- **Description**: Storing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) directly in the codebase.
- *Code**:
  - Hardcoding AWS credentials in `app.py`.
- **Prevention**:
  - Use environment variables or a secrets management tool (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    ```python
    import os
    api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
    ```

---

### **1.8 Lack of Secure Model Hosting**
- **Description**: Hosting models on insecure servers leaves them vulnerable to unauthorized access.
- **Examples**:
  - Exposing a model on an open port without any authentication.
- **Prevention**:
  - Use secure model-serving frameworks like **TF Serving** or **TorchServe** behind a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX).
  - Enable HTTPS by deploying SSL/TLS certificates.

---

### **1.9 Improper Input Validation**
- **Description**: Allowing unvalidated inputs can lead to injection attacks or system crashes.
- **Code**:
  - A user sends corrupted JSON that crashes the API.
- **Prevention**:
  - Validate incoming requests using JSON schemas.
    ```python
    from jsonschema import validate, ValidationError

    schema = {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "feature1": {"type": "number"},
            "feature2": {"type": "number"}
        },
        "required": ["feature1", "feature2"]
    }

    try:
        validate(instance=request.json, schema=schema)
    except ValidationError as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}, 400
    ```

## **2. Setting Up Snyk with a CI/CD Pipeline**

### **2.1 Overview of Snyk**
- **Purpose**: Snyk identifies and fixes vulnerabilities in dependencies, Docker images, and infrastructure as code (IaC).
- **Integration**: Works with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, and other CI/CD tools.

---

### **2.2 Prerequisites**
1. **Install Snyk CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g snyk
   ```
2. **Authenticate Snyk**:
   ```bash
   snyk auth
   ```
   Follow the link provided and log in with your Snyk account.

3. **Add Your Project to Snyk**:
   ```bash
   snyk monitor
   ```

---

### **2.3 Integrating Snyk with GitHub Actions**

1. **Set Up a Workflow**:
   - Create a `.github/workflows/snyk.yml` file:
     ```yaml
     name: Snyk Security Scan

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main
       pull_request:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       security:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - name: Checkout Code
             uses: actions/checkout@v3

           - name: Set Up Python
             uses: actions/setup-python@v4
             with:
               python-version: 3.9

           - name: Install Dependencies
             run: pip install -r requirements.txt

           - name: Run Snyk Test
             env:
               SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
             run: snyk test
     ```

2. **Store Snyk Token**:
   - Go to **GitHub Repository Settings > Secrets > Actions** and add `SNYK_TOKEN` with your Snyk API token.

3. **How It Works**:
   - On every push or pull request, the workflow:
     - Installs dependencies.
     - Runs `snyk test`, which scans for vulnerabilities and outputs a detailed report.

### **2.4 Integrating Snyk with Jenkins**

1. **Install Snyk Plugin**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins** and install the **Snyk Security** plugin.

2. **Configure Snyk in Jenkins**:
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins > Configure System**.
   - Add your **Snyk API token** under the "Snyk" section.

3. **Add Snyk to Your Jenkins Pipeline**:
   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any
       stages {
           stage('Security Scan') {
               steps {
                   snykSecurity test: '', failOnIssues: true
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **2.5 Monitoring Vulnerabilities**
- **Snyk Monitor**:
  - Run this command to continuously monitor your project:
    ```bash
    snyk monitor
    ```
  - View the results in the Snyk dashboard.

---

### **2.6 Best Practices for Snyk**
1. **Integrate at Every Stage**:
   - Scan dependencies, Docker images, and IaC configurations during development and deployment.
2. **Automate Fixes**:
   - Use `snyk fix` to automatically resolve vulnerabilities:
     ```bash
     snyk fix
     ```

---
